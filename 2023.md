The Reproducible AGILE team is happy to contribute to the AGILE conference 2023 by organising the reproducibility review, continueing an exemplary practice in Open Scholarship from the previous years.
For the fourth time, a reproducibility review is conducted with all accepted full papers based on the mandatory [reproducible paper guidelines](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/CB7Z8).

**The reproducibility reviews are published on OSF at ðŸ‘‰ <https://osf.io/2k56f/> ðŸ‘ˆ**.

## Report

Reproducible AGILE  community member Carlos presented an overview on the reproducibility review process and its results on behalf of reproducibility committee chair Daniel NÃ¼st at the final day of the conference.
The slides are published at <https://osf.io/7ugm6>.

10 papers of 14 accepted manuscripts were successfully (partially) reproduced.
This corresponds to 71% percent of accepted papers.

A more extensive written report is published in [the document about the reproducibility review process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JHCQV7GP3YkKwp0Nii3dt3p3Y45hU56Xz2cr-xJVz34/edit#).

If you want to get a quick overview about previous reproducibility reviews, [take a look at the presentation by reproducibility committee chair Daniel NÃ¼st at the Munin conference]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020).
All non-rejected submissions, i.e., papers that are accepted or have minor revisions only, will be screened for reproducibility based on the information provided in the Data and Software Availability section.

The reproducibility review happens after the scientific review, because some papers are irreproducible for good reason (e.g., conceptual work) and are still published.
Successfully reproduced papers will receive the Reproducible AGILE badge, see the [2020 proceedings](https://agile-giss.copernicus.org/articles/1/index.html) for some examples.
