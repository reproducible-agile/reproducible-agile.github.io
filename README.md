## Site management

The design is based on [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) by Mark Otto.
The instructions assume you manage your Ruby installation with [`rvm`](https://rvm.io/).

```bash
# install required software (if you're using a different system, consider deleting Gemfile.lock for a working configuration)
# rvm install ruby-2.7 --with-openssl-dir=$HOME/.rvm/usr (on Ubuntu 22.04, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72179373/cant-install-ruby-via-rvm-error-running-rvm-make-j4-on-ubuntu-22-04)
# bundle install

rvm use ruby-2.7

bundle exec jekyll serve # build the site
```

### Ribbon

A generic "Fork me" ribbon has been added and can be configured (text, link) in the file `_config.yml`. The color is configured in `public/css/agile.css`. The ribbon appears on all pages via `_layouts/default.html`, and stylesheets are included in `_includes/head_default.html` if enabled.

### Exclude pages from menu

If you do not want a page to appear in the left hand side menu, include the parameter `exclude_from_nav: true` in the page's frontmatter.

### Privacy
