# Reproducible Research @ AGILE

This website is home of workshops and an [AGILE INITIATIVE](https://agile-online.org/funding-initiatives) on the topic of [Reproducible Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research) in connection with the [Association of Geographic Information Laboratories in Europe's](https://agile-online.org/) (AGILE) [annual conference series](https://agile-online.org/past-conferences-and-proceedings).

- [Reproducibility review 2021](2021)
- [Short paper postprints](short-paper-postprints)
- [Reproducibility review 2020](2020)
- [Reproducible Publications at AGILE Conferences](initiative) (initiative & meeting, 2018-2019)

## About

Reproducibility and replicability of research gains more attention each year across many domains, some of which even struggle with a "reproducibility crisis".
However, at AGILE conferences, the topic is underrepresented.
Recent research found that none of the last years nominees for best papers (both short & full papers) provided sufficient information (i.e. instructions, data, and code) to be reproduced independently by a third party.

Learn more about the state of reproducibility at AGILE and what can be done about it in the peer-reviewed articles ["Reproducible research and GIScience: an evaluation using _AGILE conference_ papers"](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5072) and [Reproducible Research and GIScience: An Evaluation Using _GIScience Conference_ Papers](https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPICS.GISCIENCE.2021.II.2).
Read more about past, ongoing, and future activities & strategy in the preprint ["Reproducible Research is like riding a bike"](https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.27216v1) presented at the 5th Open Source Geospatial Research and Education Symposium ([OGRS 2018](http://2018.ogrs-community.org/)).

The workshops are organised by [a group of Open Science and Reproducible Research enthusiasts](#team).
The events introduce interested scientists and developers to the concepts of reproducible research, raise awareness of challenges around computational reproducibility in science within the AGILE community, and give hands-on guidance on how to increase the degree of reproducibility for the participant's own work.
